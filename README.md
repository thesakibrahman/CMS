The Content Management System (CMS) is one of the most popular tools used to manage digital content. CMS allows users to create, edit, and publish digital content on various platforms with ease. CMS is widely used in various fields like digital marketing, e-commerce, news websites, and blogs. This mini project aims to develop a CMS in which college administrators, professors, and students can easily create and publish content, while also ensuring that it is organized, searchable, and easily accessible. Additionally, a CMS can help maintain consistency in the branding and messaging of the college, while also allowing for collaboration among different content creators. Overall, a CMS can be an essential tool for managing the complex and diverse content needs of a modern college.
